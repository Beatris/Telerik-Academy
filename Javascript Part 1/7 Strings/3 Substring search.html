        Write a JavaScript function that finds how many times a substring is contained 
        <br />
        in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
        <br />
        Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. 
        <br />
        Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
        <br />
        The result is: 9.
    </p>

    <input type="text" id="input" />
    <button onclick="CheckForSubstringOnClick()">Check For Substring</button>
    <div id="js-console"></div>
    <script src="scripts/js-console.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var text = "We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. " +
        "Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days. ";

        function CheckForSubstringOnClick() {
            var substring = jsConsole.read("#input").toString();
            jsConsole.writeLine(checkSubstring(substring));
        }

        function checkSubstring(substring) {
            var pattern = new RegExp(substring.toString(), "gi");
            return text.match(pattern).length;
        }
    </script>
